List of targets for each person.

A target is:
  time, x, y, rot.

Always animate w/ beat: either "keep time" (in place) or an
 appropriate amount of "press ahead", "sashay left", "sashay right",
   or "press back", depending on motion vector/facing direction.

              motion vec
facing dir | /
           |/__ <- sashay component.
           ^
           press ahead/back component.

Also need 'turn left' and 'turn right' movements.  All movements
should be two part (left foot, then right foot), but 1 beat = 1 step
(ie, half the cycle).  "Scoot back", for example, is 3 beats: 1 step
straight ahead, 1 turning step for trade, 1 step straight back.
So always interpolating between three keyframes, one for "x", one for
"y", and one for rotation.  (Writing animation for rotation will be
tricky: best start with spine rotating smoothly, then move all bones,
and then reset the rotation on the spine.)

Should use an independent timer to run camera homing, so that it not
dependent on song timing.  Current values are okay for 96<FPS<170.
** Rather than fixed rate pan/tilt, write an acceleration profile
which will return to 'home' in 1 beat.  Record distance from target
of 'last user override' (ie, change of view or manual pan/tilt).
Based on current distance, apply /\ acceleration (increase velocity
unless we're at midpoint, else decrease.)  Need some math to figure
out what the delta V should be, based on actual dist/total dist.

Should use frame-rate limited display: 15fps?  30fps?

Also, use relative vertex animation for: head turns, smiles, hand
movements.  These are cycles, but we subtract the frame vertices from
the start vertices to get a displacement, and then apply the
displacement over whatever else is going on.  Also 'dropping'
something, and sound effects (claps, etc).

If the dancers are left stopped without a command, they should
initiate a 1-2 beat (randomize start/end points?) head turn in the
caller's direction (limited by neck mobility) -- also eye turn?

Dancers should also look towards their partners if their partner is
'near enough'.


The checkers can have a walking animation, too, tilting up & down and
'walking' across the table.  Maybe include global translation/rotation
matrix in keyframining?
---------

More points for sequences near 'optimal length' (ie, not too long or
short).

Points for consistent flow (flow meter increases, reset to zero on bad
flow).

Points for continuous calling (same deal, or maybe a bonus for a
continuous resolved sequence.)

Dancers may 'drop' objects: points for getting the dancer who dropped
the item to the place where it (randomly) ends up within a certain
time period.

Difficulty level: tempo, dancer appearance (arky/identical),
'turkeys'.

Bonus for recovering after a turkey.

Maybe caller movement as well to receive bonuses.

----
splice 'miditimers' together to allow switching tunes?
 each time measurement is a rational number; pass this rational number
 between timers atomically to ensure monoticity.  main timer is just a
 switch.

Support sampled sound (wav/mp3) via "beat maps" -- a list of
 (beat number, micro-second location) pairs which are smoothly
 interpolated to reconstruct beat number from the playback us
 location.
