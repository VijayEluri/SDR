List of targets for each person.

A target is:
  time, x, y, rot.

Always animate w/ beat: either "keep time" (in place) or an
 appropriate amount of "press ahead", "sashay left", "sashay right",
   or "press back", depending on motion vector/facing direction.

              motion vec
facing dir | /
           |/__ <- sashay component.
           ^
           press ahead/back component.

Should use an independent timer to run camera homing, so that it not
dependent on song timing.  Current values are okay for 96<FPS<170.

Should use frame-rate limited display.
