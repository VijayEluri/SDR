C4 calls, Richard Tuck's C4 Teach Order tip 1.3

This should be a danceable sequence.

x Tag the Star
 - facing couples, to n/4 tag
x <ATC> the Yellow Brick Road / Yellow Bricking <any call>
  - <atc> (or waves) to 1/4 tag
  - <anything> from 2fl
x Run Wild
  - 3/4 run wild from waves gives box
x Outpost
  - lines w/ at least 1 end looking out, ends in waves
  - 3 parts.  do 'finish' or 'like a'  from 1/4 tag. 1/3 or 2/3 gives 1/4 tag
x Make a Pass variations
  - [cross] make a pass but <anything>
  - from 1/4 tag gives lines facing
  - from 1/4 line gives 3-and-1 lines
x Hammerlane (two of them)
  - from facing couples, to 2fl
x Replace the Column But <any call>
  - <anycall> from waves. from columns, nominally to 2fl.
x Contour the Line
  - 4 parts, exploit division
x Counterpoint
  - centers recycle (whatever kind) while ends counter rotate
x Connect
  - from diamond to box. interesting when centers are a couple
