C4 calls, Richard Tuck's C4 Teach Order tip 5.2

This should be a danceable sequence.

* right/left on -- from facing couples or waves, to facing couples or
                 single eight chain.  try w/ generous/stingy?
- bail out -- from lines facing out, to columns. also others formations
            try 'central', 'invert', 'snag', etc.
- n/4 chain and circulate in -- from lines w/ odd n and diamonds if even
  do from t-bones? change lanes = 1/4 chain and circulate in.
  see change lanes. from magic column after centers counter rotate, or
   rh wave after centers counter rotate
  1/2 chain and circulate in from twin diamonds
spin a wheel - from parallel two faced lines to parallel two faced lines
  apply concepts: finally cross concentric spin & wheel takes
   parallel two faced lines to a tidal two faced line.
  finish generous spin a wheel takes a spindle to parallel two faced lines
straightfire: parallel two-faced line to column
              parallel lines facing out to starting DPT
              parallel lines facing in to completed DPT
*              twin facing diamonds to t-boned column/wave
* cross and divide: general line to couples back to back
* ship ahoy: from parallel ocean waves to starting DPT
* cross linear cycle: from general line (typ 2-faced lines, but also
                 waves and 1-faced lines) to facing couples
