C4 calls, Richard Tuck's C4 Teach Order tip 5.3

This should be a danceable sequence.

* round off - back to back lines, to starting dpt
* out roll to a wave - twin diamonds to parallel waves
                   - or from waves to c1 phantom parallel waves
* cross to an interlocked diamond / hourglass
                     from lines, to interlocked diamond / hourglass
* turn by - from eight chain or trade by, turn by N 1/2 yields twin diamonds
* curve right / left - space invader ... use to get out of c1 phantoms?
* swing chain the line - from tidal wave or facing lines, ends in parallel lines
                       "but" means replace the final centers cast 3/4
* right / left anchor - space invader
                      from lines facing out, to parallelogram lines facing in
                      from parallelogram lines facing out, to eight chain
* straight connect - twin diamonds, to columns

/// can we do cross to a diamond from t-bones such that the centers
/// are in completed DPT (columns)
