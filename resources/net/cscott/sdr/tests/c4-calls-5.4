C4 calls, Richard Tuck's C4 Teach Order tip 5.4

This should be a danceable sequence.

* Flare the star: from facing couples to facing couples.
* Dixie daisy: from facing couples to single completed DPT.
  - use split dixie daisy from sq set?
* Round the horn: from back to back lines, to t-boned 2x4
  - follow w/ concentric mini chase, then <centers> break the alamo?
* (cross) Clover the horn: from completed double pass thru, to t-boned 2x4
* erase: from waves to diamonds.  from diamonds to waves.
* Swing chain the gears - waves or eight chain -> waves
* Swing chain the star - 2,1,2,1 quarter the deucey: waves->waves
o Swing chain and circulate the gears
o Swing chain and circulate in - waves or eight chain -> tfl
* Clover the wave - from waves to start dpt
* <anything> the wave - from waves to ?
* Remember the alamo - from parallel waves to O spots
* <anyone> break the alamo - from O spots or t-bone 2x4, to 2fl
* Tap the [anyone] - from facing couples to facing couples (same orientation)
  four parts, use concepts.
    after 1st part should have couples back to back
    after 2nd part should have boxes (ideally)
   - so from starting DPT w/ boys in tandem, initially tandem tap the boys
