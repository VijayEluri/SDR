/**
 * This package contains useful utility code.  In particular, our exact

 * as some classes using our rational numbers to represent
 * {@link net.cscott.sdr.util.Interval}s,
 * {@link net.cscott.sdr.util.Point}s, and 
 * {@link net.cscott.sdr.util.Box}es.  Some attempts to reduce the verbosity
 * of map and list creation and manipulation are in
 * {@link net.cscott.sdr.util.Tools} and {@link net.cscott.sdr.util.ListUtils}.
